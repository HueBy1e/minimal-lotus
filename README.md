CSS Snippets for Obsidian. Personal adjustments for [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal).

## Installation

1. Download the CSS snippets and move them into the folder `.obsidian/snippets/` located in your vault folder.
2. In Obsidian, go to `Settings ➞ Appearance`, and activate the snippets.

## Font

I recommend to install the [IBM Plex®](https://github.com/IBM/plex) font family in your system. 

If you do want to have IBM Plex as the main font, or any other font for that matter, you can install the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) Plugin, and add them under `Typography`➞`Fonts`, in the Style Settings Plugin Options.
